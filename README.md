# Cell-Cluster-Analysis
Program to analyze H&amp;E images of cells in 3D culture to identify cluster area and circularity.

Program is designed to run through a folder with images named in numerical order. Not designed to iterate through groups. Images should be thresholded before being saved/analyzed in program. Adobe Photoshop was used (threshold value 128) for all images. Range of analysis [800 80000] should be upated based on pixels to microns and can be updated to users preference.
